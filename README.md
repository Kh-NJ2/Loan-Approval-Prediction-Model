# Loan Approval Prediction Project

## Objective
Build a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant information and financial data.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Loan Approval Dataset (Kaggle or similar)  
- **Problem Type**: Binary Classification  
- **Focus**: Handling imbalanced data and evaluating performance with precision, recall, and F1-score  

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn**: Preprocessing, modeling, evaluation  
- **Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)**: Balancing classes  
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization  

---

### Handle Class Imbalance
- Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**  
- Balanced the training set for better model learning
<br><br>
### Models Trained
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
<br><br>
### Evaluation
- **Metrics Used**: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix  
- Compared Logistic Regression and Decision Tree on weighted F1-score
